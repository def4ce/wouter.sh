      <description>If you have to SSH into your servers, then your automation has failed.
I know, crazy&amp;hellip;
To make the transition to this mindset easier you could just disable access to port 22 in your instance security group configuration. This will highlight the things you still need to automate while still having the ability to enable access your instances to remedy immediate operational issues.
Disabling inbound SSH will stop you from cheating.</description>

      <title>Setting up an SSH server as a proxy</title>

      <description>Recently I setup an SSH server at home. This allows me, besides the obvious, to create an SSH tunnel to encrypt my connections and circumvent restrictions. This is particularly useful on public Wi-Fi networks. These networks may block certain services and other people using the network might be less friendly.
Installing Your Linux server most likely already has openssh-server installed. If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t, installing SSH server is easy. Because I use CentOS the examples will reflect that.</description>
