I am a seasoned **Cloud Engineer** committed to architecting, developing, and upholding highly reliable, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions within [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for [MyParcel](https://www.myparcel.nl).

With a solid foundation in operations, I have extensive experience in managing intricate environments tailored to meet unique requirements. My expertise lies in leveraging the robust capabilities of AWS to deliver optimized cloud infrastructures that drive efficiency and innovation.

Outside the realm of cloud engineering, I have a profound love for gaming, encompassing both video games and an array of board and card games. This hobby not only fuels my competitive spirit but also sharpens my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills, attributes that I bring into my professional life. Additionally, maintaining a healthy balance between mind and body is important to me, which is why I frequent the gym, embracing the discipline and resilience it cultivates.
