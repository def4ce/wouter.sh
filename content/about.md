Hey internet, welcome to my blog.  
  
My name is Wouter and I'm Cloud Engineer at Coolblue, building a cloud platform for our developers to deploy their apps on.
  
I am also father to Sid and Fay, partner to Donna. I love music and playing games, both tabletop and video.
  
The point of this blog is to improve my writing skill, try to be more extrovert while  providing some useful technical information and a place for my resume.
